We need to create a Polygon class with the following properties:
- Number of vertices n - passed to the initializer
- circumradius R - passed to the initializer 
- number of edges
- number of sides 
- interior angles (in degrees)
- side length 
- apothem 
- surface area
- perimeter 
- supports equality based on numbers of vertices and circumradius 
- supports > based on numbers of vertices
