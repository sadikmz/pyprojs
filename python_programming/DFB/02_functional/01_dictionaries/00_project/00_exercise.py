Write a Python function that will create and return a dictionary from another dictionary,
but sorted by value. You can assume the values are all comparable and have a natural sort order.

For example, given the following dictionary:

composers  = {'Johanna': 65, 'Ludwig': 56, 'Frederic': 39, 'Wolfgang': 35}

Your function should return a dictionary that looks like the following:

sorted_composers  = {
'Wolfgang': 35,
'Frederic': 39,
'Ludwig': 56,
'Johanna': 65 }

Exercise 2
Given two dictionaries, d1 and d2, write a function that create a dictionary that contains only
the keys common to both dictionaries, with values being a tuple containing from d1 and d2. (Order of keys is not important)

Example, given tow dictionaries as follows:
d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3,'d':4}
d2 = {'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'y': 40,'z': 50}

Your function should return a dictionary that looks like the following:
d = {'b': (2,20), 'c': (3,30)}

Hint: s1 & s2 returns intersection of two sets

"""
You have text data spread across multiple servers.
Each server is able to analyze this data and return a dictionary that contains words and their frequency.

Your job is to combine this data to create a single dictionary that contains all the words and their 
combined frequencies from all these data sources. Bonus points if you can make your dictionary sorted by frequency (highest to lowest).
For example, you may have three servers that each return these dictionaries:

# Exercise 4

For this exercise suppose you have a web API load balanced across multiple nodes. 
This API receives various requests for resources and logs each request to some local storage. 
Each instance of the API is able to return a dictionary containing the resource that was accessed 
(the dictionary key) and the number of times it was requested (the associated value).

Your task here is to identify resources that have been requested on some, but not all the servers, 
so you can determine if you have an issue with your load balancer not distributing certain resource 
requests across all nodes.

For simplicity, we will assume that there are exactly 3 nodes in the cluster.

You should write a function that takes 3 dictionaries as arguments 
for node 1, node 2, and node 3, and returns a dictionary that contains only keys 
that are not found in **all** of the dictionaries. The value should be a list containing 
the number of times it was requested in each node (the node order should match the 
dictionary (node) order passed to your function). Use `0` if the resource was not requested 
from the corresponding node.

# Suppose your dictionaries are for logs of all the GET requests on each node:

n3 = {'employees': 150, 'users': 4, 'login': 1000}

# Your result should then be:
result = {'employee': (5000, 0, 0),
          'user': (100, 230, 0),
          'login': (0, 0, 1000)}

# Tip:
# to find the difference between two sets, you can subtract one from the other:
# s1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# s2 = {1, 2, 3}
# s1 - s2

# Tip: to get the union of two (or more) sets you can use the `|` operator:
# s1 = {1, 2, 3}
# s2 = {2, 3, 4}
# s1 | s2

# Tip: to get the intersection of two (or more) sets you can use the `&` operator:
# s1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
# s2 = {2, 3}
# s1 & s2
# {2,3}
# Hint: It might be helpful to draw out a set diagram and consider what subset you are trying to isolate.
